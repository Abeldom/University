### In this project I was interested in the map generating rules of the game, but it is playable via keyboard inputs.
My idea was to generate a map for this game which satisfies the following rules:
- The first click is always safe, with no bombs;
- it is not possible that a bomb has only bomb neighbors;
- the number of bombs is directly correlated with the game's difficulty level;

Further development opportunity:
- input via mouse (left click=reveal, right click=put/take away flag);
