### In this project I was interested in the map generating rules of the game. The game can be tried out through keyboard inputs.
### My idea was to generate a map for this game which satisfies the following rules:
- the first tip is guaranteed to be not bomb
- it is not possible that a bomb has only bomb neighbors
- the number of bombs is directly correlated with the game's difficulty level.
