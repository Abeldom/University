#### This grid game was developed by John Convay. The map of the game consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead, and evolves according to simple rules based on the states of its neighbors. An initial state is needed, then the process can start.
The player of this game has the following options:
- press Space bar --> the rules become valid/invalid
- press Click on a square --> the cell becomes alive/dead
