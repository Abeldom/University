### In this project, I am utilizing the box counting dimension method to calculate the Minkowski dimension of an object.
### I tested the method on various shapes, including regular ones like a circle, as well as fractals such as Koch and Sierpinski. I predominantly generated the fractal images using my Python programs because they allowed me to create images of arbitrary precision, which was necessary for my calculations.

### In the results.txt folder, I have saved my results, alongside which the real dimension values can be found.  It can be seen, that the algorithm is working correctly.
